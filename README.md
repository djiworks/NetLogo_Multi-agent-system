Ant labyrinth simulation 
(Multi Agent System)
==========================

This software has for aim the study of an ants’ colony behaviour to find the exit in a labyrinth. 

This use case was made to learn more NetLogo Software on a Multi Agent System.
This model has many features and you will be able to see the influence of different events in the simulation. 

This model can be improved, the possibilities are numerous.
