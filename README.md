Ant labyrinth simulation
==========================

This software consists on simulating a behavior to find the exit in a labyrinth. This use case is made to learn NetLogo Software on a Multi Agent System.

Building...
V0.1: Make a simple model with simple start and end points, one ant family. (OK)
V0.2: Add signals to the environnement to inform how to go to the end point.
V0.2.1: Add ant signal to send information between ants (informing neighbors)
V0.3: Add a second family (one with random movements to the right and the second one to the left).
V0.3: Add stats control and final comments on the code
