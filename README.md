This use case was made to learn more NetLogo Software on a Multi Agent System.
This model has many features and you will be able to see the influence of different events in the simulation. 

This model can be improved, the possibilities are numerous. 



Building history...

V0.1: Make a simple and basic model with only a start point and end points, one ant family. (OK)

V0.2: Adding signals (help) in the environment to inform ants how to go to the labyrinth’s exit. (OK)
